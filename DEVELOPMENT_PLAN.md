# Protein Finder Development Plan

## Overview

A mobile application for searching and comparing protein content from official nutrition data of restaurant chains.

## Development Methodology

- **TDD (Test-Driven Development)**: Red → Green → Refactor cycle
- **SOLID Principles**: Maintainable and extensible architecture
- **Accessibility First**: WCAG AA compliance target
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns

## Phase 1: Mobile Application (Weeks 1-3)

### Week 1: Foundation

#### Day 1-2: Project Setup

- [x] Initialize Expo project with TypeScript
- [ ] Configure ESLint, Prettier, and Git hooks
- [ ] Set up directory structure following Clean Architecture
- [ ] Create base documentation (README, TODO)

#### Day 3-4: Core Domain & Testing

- [ ] Define core domain models with TypeScript
  - MenuItem, NutrientValue, SearchCriteria
  - Implement Specification Pattern for flexible filtering
- [ ] Set up testing infrastructure (Jest, React Testing Library)
- [ ] Write domain model tests (TDD approach)

#### Day 5-7: Data Layer

- [ ] Implement SQLite database layer
  - Schema design with proper normalization
  - Repository pattern implementation
  - Unit tests for all repository methods
- [ ] Implement API client layer
  - ETag/If-None-Match support
  - Retry logic and error handling
  - Mock API for development

### Week 2: UI Implementation

#### Day 8-9: Design System & Navigation

- [ ] Create design tokens (Apple/Netflix inspired)
- [ ] Implement base UI components with accessibility
- [ ] Set up navigation structure (expo-router)

#### Day 10-12: Main Screens

- [ ] Menu List Screen
  - FlashList for performance
  - Search and filter functionality
  - Pull to refresh
- [ ] Menu Detail Screen
  - Nutrition information display
  - Share functionality
  - Source URL linking

#### Day 13-14: Settings & Sync

- [ ] Settings Screen
  - Push notification preferences
  - Data policy display
- [ ] Implement sync logic
  - Initial full sync
  - Delta updates with cursor
  - Offline support

### Week 3: Polish & Testing

#### Day 15-16: Accessibility

- [ ] WCAG Level A compliance
- [ ] Screen reader support
- [ ] Keyboard navigation
- [ ] Focus management

#### Day 17-18: Performance & UX

- [ ] FlashList optimization
- [ ] Animation implementation (with reduced motion)
- [ ] Loading states and error handling
- [ ] Empty states

#### Day 19-21: Integration Testing

- [ ] E2E tests for critical user flows
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Accessibility testing
- [ ] Bug fixes and refinements

## Phase 2: Backend Development (Week 4)

### Day 22-23: API Design & Setup

- [ ] REST API design
- [ ] Database schema (PostgreSQL/SQLite)
- [ ] Development environment setup

### Day 24-25: Scraper Implementation

- [ ] Base scraper class
- [ ] Chain-specific scrapers (3 chains minimum)
- [ ] Data normalization logic
- [ ] Unit conversion (mg to g)

### Day 26-27: API Implementation

- [ ] Implement REST endpoints
- [ ] ETag support
- [ ] CORS configuration
- [ ] Rate limiting

### Day 28: Deployment

- [ ] Cloud Run setup
- [ ] Cloud Scheduler configuration
- [ ] Monitoring setup (Sentry)
- [ ] Initial data population

## Phase 3: Integration & Release (Week 5)

### Day 29-30: Integration

- [ ] Connect mobile app to production API
- [ ] Push notification setup
- [ ] End-to-end testing

### Day 31-32: Release Preparation

- [ ] App Store assets
- [ ] Privacy policy
- [ ] EAS Build configuration
- [ ] Beta testing

### Day 33-35: Launch

- [ ] TestFlight/Internal testing
- [ ] Bug fixes from beta feedback
- [ ] App Store submission

## Milestones

### MVP (End of Week 3)

- ✅ 3+ chains with 300+ menu items
- ✅ Search and filter by protein content
- ✅ Serving/100g differentiation
- ✅ Offline support
- ✅ Source attribution

### Beta (End of Week 4)

- ✅ All MVP features
- ✅ Push notifications
- ✅ Daily data updates
- ✅ Performance optimized

### v1.0 Release (End of Week 5)

- ✅ App Store ready
- ✅ WCAG Level A compliant
- ✅ <1% crash rate
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

- **Scraping failures**: Implement robust error handling and fallbacks
- **API rate limits**: Implement caching and throttling
- **Performance issues**: Use FlashList and optimize queries

### Mitigation Strategies

- Start with mock data for parallel development
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout
- Maintain detailed logging and monitoring

## Success Metrics

- User can find high-protein meals in <3 taps
- App loads in <2 seconds
- Search returns results in <500ms
- 99.9% uptime for API
- Daily successful data updates

## Communication Plan

- Daily progress updates in TODO.md
- Weekly milestone reviews
- Immediate escalation of blockers
- Documentation updates with each feature
